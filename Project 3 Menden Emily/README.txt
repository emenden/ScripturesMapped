User feedback:
 One user told me that having the ability to navigate to the map when the map was already visible in split view was confusing. I would need to limit when that button is enabed. 

Sharing a scripture-related experience with this person:
	The person who reviewed my app was my husband and we are both taking President Nelson's challenge to read the Book of Mormon by the end of the year. We had fun playing with my app and looking up all the places in the chapters we've been reading recently.
